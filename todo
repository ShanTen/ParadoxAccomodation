1. Create 3 navigation options/buttons for the user to select from. -- done
    - Home 
    - QR Scanner 
    - Settings

2. Create a directory called "Screens" inside (tabs) folder. -- ignore
    - Create 3 files inside the "Screens" folder.
        - HomeScreen.js
        - QRScannerScreen.js
        - SettingsScreen.js

3. Finish Upcoming Student Scroll View. -- done
4. Finish Accommodator Profile Page -- done
5. Rename variables -- done

BIG TODO:
    SET UP STACK NAVIGATOR SUCH THAT THE USER CAN NAVIGATE BETWEEN THE 3 (OR MORE) SCREENS

6. Make sure app compiles with correct name
7. Implement GetUpcomingStudents function to simulate API call and implement a useEvent hook for it

Notes:
1. Edit navigation settings and config in ./app/(tabs)/_layouts.tsx
2. Do all code only in ./app/(tabs)/*
    - Note on Why: This is to keep the code organized and clean. 
    - Tree of This working Env is cleaner than what the expo generate code provides.
3. Dont remove the code In /App at App root level.
    - This is used to render the HTMl view of the app.
